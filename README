Rails-Compass-Sass-Generator
============================

Bootstrap the process of moving your Rails project's stylings
from CSS to SASS.

Sales pitch:

What is SASS?  Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets!  You could call it
a simple programming language for CSS, with all the power that implies.
Visit http://sass-lang.com/ for more details.

Compass is a simple but honest-to-god CSS framework based on SASS.
It lets you write your rules in SASS, and automagically updates your
CSS files for you.  Visit http://compass-style.org/ for more details.

Rails is awesome.  You should use it.

This generator will do the following for you:

  1) Set up a working compass installation for your project.
  2) Installs a couple of tasks to make things a bit easier.
     (see below).
  3) If you have no existing CSS in public/stylesheets, adds
     some default rules.



To install:

From your Rails root, issue the command:
$ git clone git@github.com:darthschmoo/rails-compass-sass-generator.git vendor/generators/compass_sass

or clone it into your ~/.rails/generators directory.



To use:
$ script/generate compass_sass
Installing compass/sass-related files and tasks.

To import your new stylesheets add the following lines of HTML (or equivalent) to your webpage:
<head>
  <link href="/stylesheets/screen.css" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  <link href="/stylesheets/print.css" media="print" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  <!--[if IE]>
      <link href="/stylesheets/ie.css" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  <![endif]-->
</head>



rake compass:import             # migrates existing .css files from the
                                # public/stylesheets directory, if the
                                # related .sass files don't exist.

rake compass:watch              # regenerates css from source sass files
                                # as you work on them.
